The games 
 
Game 1 – Italian Game 
Adolf Anderssen 
Jean Dufresne 
Berlin 1852 
This is one of Anderssen’s two most famous 
games, the ‘Immortal’ against Kieseritzky being 
the other. This one has attracted a great deal of 
analysis over the years, especially Black’s 19th 
move. We hope we have now finally been able 
to answer the questions once and for all. 
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.b4 
The Evans Gambit has proved one of the more 
enduring of the classical gambit openings, 
bringing Kasparov two devastating wins in his 
only two serious outings with it, and also 
proving a useful point-scorer for Nigel Short. 
But nowadays it is believed to have finally been 
pretty much ‘solved’ at top level. One might 
think that such gambits would be the first to be 
refuted in the modern engine age. However, it’s 
turned out that piece activity and open lines and 
diagonals are the most valuable of all currencies 
for modern engines, and that a lost pawn in the 
opening is often just a minor inconvenience if 
dynamic chances are present. This was brought 
home to me (Matthew) most recently when I 
submitted the Evans-esque 1.e4 1...Nc6 2.b4?!? 
(the brainchild of English IM Richard Palliser) 
as an opening for the TCEC (the leading engine 
competition) Superfinal (a 100-game match 
played at long time controls from pre-specified 
opening 
positions) 
between 
top 
engines 
Stockfish and Leela. The games were played at 
classical time controls on extremely impressive 
hardware, but neither engine made any 
impression as Black. The tempo gained on the 
black knight after capturing on b4, and the open 
lines and diagonals created by the absence of a 
b-pawn were more than enough to balance the 
game with counterplay. 
4...Bxb4 5.c3 Ba5 6.d4 
 
6...exd4 
Subsequently, Black normally followed a solid 
plan of defence attributed to Lasker but which 
was first played by Salwe in 1908 against Rudolf 
Spielmann: 6...d6 7.Qb3 Qd7 8.0-0 Bb6. This is 
the linchpin of the plan, and Salwe also played 
this manoeuvre twice in 1906 when he faced the 
Evans Gambit (though White did not play 
7.Qb3). The loose bishop on a5 is brought back 
to safety; by doing so the a5-square is freed 
which the knight on c6 can use profitably to 
exchange off a key white attacker: the bishop on 
c4. 9.Nbd2 Na5 10.Qc2 and now: 
 
analysis diagram 
A) 10...Nxc4 11.Nxc4 Qc6 is an alternative way of 
returning the pawn to blunt the white initiative. 
It has been tried a few times in human games, 
mostly in rapid and blitz: 12.Nxb6 axb6 13.dxe5 
dxe5 14.Nxe5 Qa4 15.Qd3 Nf6 16.Re1 (16.Qg3 has 
been the human choice in blitz and obviously 
caused some worries and problems for the black 
player!: 16...0-0 17.Bh6 Nh5 18.Qf3 and now the 
engine line is the lovely 18...f6 19.Qxh5 Qe8 

20.Qxe8 Rxe8 21.Nd3 gxh6 with no problems for 
Black) 16...0-0 17.Bg5 Nd7 18.Nxd7 Qxd7 19.Qg3 
Ra4 20.Bf4 Rc4 21.f3 ½-½ Dragon 3.1-Stockfish, 
Classics 2022; 
B) 10...Qe7 11.Ba3 Qf6 12.Bb5+ c6 13.Be2 Ne7 
14.Bb4 Bc7 15.Rfd1 0-0 was a Stockfish attempt 
to keep the extra pawn. The offside knight on a5 
gives Black a few headaches but Black’s position 
is basically solid, ½-½ (25) Dragon 3.1-Stockfish, 
Classics 2022; 
C) 10...Ne7. This line, returning the sacrificed 
pawn for easy development has the been the 
most popular in the modern game. 11.dxe5 Ng6 
12.exd6 Qxd6 13.e5 Qc6 14.Be2 Nf4 15.Bd1 0-0 
16.Ne4 Ng6 17.Re1 Nc4 18.Ned2 Nxd2 19.Bxd2 
Be6 20.a4 Rad8 ½-½ Stockfish-Dragon 3.1, 
Classics 2022. 
7.0-0 
7.Qb3 is of course also typical and interesting, 
hitting f7 immediately to disrupt Black’s 
development. 7...Qe7 8.0-0 Bb6 9.cxd4 Nxd4 
10.Nxd4 Bxd4 11.Nc3 has been seen fairly 
frequently in human games with pretty good 
results for White. 
 
7...d3 
Not the engine choice, but a very reasonable 
idea to destroy any hope White might have of 
gaining a double pawn centre as compensation 
for the sacrificed pawn. On the downside, it is a 
non-developing pawn move in response to 
White’s lead in development, so it obviously 
involves some risk. But the text, though not best, 
is certainly not so bad. 
7...Nge7 is the main choice at top level these 
days. 
7...Nf6 was the engine preference, though it too 
is not without risk: 8.Ba3 d6 9.e5 Ne4 10.exd6 
cxd6 11.Qe2 d5 12.Nxd4 Nxd4 13.cxd4. Black is 
now unable to castle, but finds a good spot for 
the king on g6! 13...f5 14.Bb3 Kf7 15.Qb5 Kg6 
16.Bxd5 h6 17.Bxe4 fxe4 18.Bb4 Bb6 19.Nc3 a6 
20.Qd5 Qxd5 ½-½ Stockfish-Dragon 3.1, Classics 
2022. 
8.Qb3 Qf6 9.e5 Qg6 
 
10.Re1?! 
Very natural, but the engines much preferred 
10.Rd1. The point is that they consider ...d6 to be 
mandatory to free Black’s position, even at the 
cost of a pawn. 10.Rd1 already lines up against 
the isolated d-pawn that will be created after 
exd6 ...cxd6. 
The engine assesses the position as equal after 
10...Nge7 11.Bxd3 Qh5 12.Nbd2 0-0 13.Ba3 d6 
14.exd6 cxd6 15.Bxd6 Rd8 16.Ne4 Be6 17.Qb2 
Nf5 18.Bf4 Qg4 19.Qc1 h6 20.h3 Qh5 21.Rb1 Bb6 
22.Kh2 Nh4 23.Nxh4 ½-½ Dragon 3.2-Stockfish, 
Classics 2023. 
10...Nge7 11.Ba3?! 
Now White should be somewhat worse. The 
engine prefers to eliminate the d3-pawn by 
11.Qd1 or 11.Re3. 
 
11...b5? 
A creative and ingenious idea to free Black’s 
queenside pieces with gain of tempo and give 

the light-squared bishop not just access to the 
c8-h3 diagonal, but to the a8-h1 diagonal. It 
doesn’t work particularly well however, because 
until Anderssen very helpfully opens the g-file 
with 17.Nf6+, Black doesn’t have much to 
combine with the light-squared bishop to create 
danger against the white position. And without 
the assistance of the light-squared bishop in 
covering the kingside light squares, Black’s 
queen is extremely vulnerable to attack by 
White’s minor pieces. 
11...d5 was again the sensible engine choice to 
free the light-squared bishop and Black’s 
queenside pieces. 12.exd6 cxd6 13.Re3 0-0 
14.Bxd3 Qh6 15.Nbd2 Be6 is a very pleasant 
position for Black, ½-½ (40) Stockfish-Dragon 
3.2, Classics 2023. 
12.Qxb5 
12.Bxb5 Rb8 13.Qa4 was the engine favourite but 
it ends up very similar to the game. Not 13...0-0? 
14.Bxe7, winning a piece. 
12...Rb8 13.Qa4 
 
13...Bb6 
Putting the bishop to safety, allowing Black to 
castle and also preventing Re3 and Bxd3. 
13...Bb7 was Dragon’s favourite, leading to some 
crazy games after 14.Re3 Bb6 15.Bxd3 f5 16.exf6 
Qxf6 17.Re2 Kd8 18.Be4 g5. A great idea, Dragon 
channelling its inner Basman to bring some new 
life into a 19th century game! 19.Nbd2 g4 20.Nd4 
Nxd4 21.cxd4 Nc6 22.Rae1 Nxd4 23.Bxb7 Nxe2+ 
24.Rxe2 Re8 25.Be4 Bd4 26.Qc4 c6 27.Bxh7 Kc7 
28.Nf1 Qf4 29.Qd3 Rxe2 30.Qxe2 Re8 31.Ne3 
Bxe3 32.fxe3 Qxe3+ 33.Qxe3 Rxe3 and Black had 
enough play with the passed c- and d-pawns to 
keep the two bishops at bay! Super play! ½-½ (57) 
Stockfish-Dragon 3.1, Classics 2022. 
14.Nbd2 
14.Qd1 0-0 15.Bxd3 Qh6 16.Nbd2 was the calm 
engine preference, when Black needs to hurry to 
secure some control over some kingside squares 
or the queen will become a target for Re1-e4-h4 
or Ne4 and Bc1: 16...d5 17.exd6 cxd6 18.Rb1 Rd8 
19.Qc2 Bg4 20.h3 Bh5 21.Bc1 Bg6 22.Ne4 Qh5 
23.Bg5 ½-½ (75) Stockfish-Dragon 3.1, Classics 
2022. Black fought out of this but it was very 
uncomfortable. 
 
14...Bb7? 
This natural move is the one the engines really 
dislike! 
It’s 
the 
logical 
continuation 
of 
Dufresne’s concept but now it’s open season for 
White’s minor pieces on the black queen. 
It is now essential to get the king out of trouble 
by means of 14...0-0. White still has a decent 
initiative after 15.Re4!, intending Bxd3, but at 
least 15...d5 was still just about holding with 
some very fraught tactics: 16.exd6 cxd6 17.Bxd3 
Bh3 18.g3 Qf6 when his position looks rather 
shaky, but is not a complete calamity: 19.Rh4 h6 
20.Qc2 (20.Rxh3? Qxc3, forking the bishop on d3 
and rook on a1, is the tactical point) 20...Ne5 
21.Rxh3 Nxf3+ 22.Nxf3 Qxf3 23.Bxd6 Rbe8 
24.Bh7+ Kh8 25.Be4 Bxf2+ 26.Qxf2 Qxe4 27.Re1 
Qf5 28.Rh4 Qd7 29.Rd4 Nc6 30.Bxf8 Nxd4 
31.Rxe8 Qxe8 32.Bxg7+ Kxg7 33.Qxd4+ Kg8 and 
Dragon had miraculously reached a holdable 
endgame! ½-½ (39) Stockfish-Dragon 3.1, 
Classics 2022. If 34.Qxa7, 34...Qe1+ 35.Kg2 Qe4+ 
36.Kf2 Qc2+ recovers the c-pawn with check 
and the resulting queen endgame is a trivial 
draw for these monsters. 
15.Ne4 Qf5?! 
A very odd move that doesn’t help matters, but 
Black’s position was in dire straits anyway. 

15...d2, to distract the white knight with 
16.Nexd2, was Black’s best, but it’s clear 
something has gone a bit wrong for Black: 16...0-
0 17.Ne4 when the threat of Bd3 leaves the black 
queen in severe trouble. 
15...0-0 16.Bxd3 Kh8 17.Nc5 wins the bishop pair 
and removes any danger against the white 
kingside with a great position to boot. 
16.Bxd3 Qh5 
 
17.Nf6+? 
An irresistible move: it might well be the first 
move one whacks out in a simultaneous display 
without a second thought! However, decisive as 
it looks, it is a serious mistake that throws away 
all of White’s advantage! In one fell swoop it 
opens the g-file and adds a rook to Black’s 
firepower against White’s kingside and that’s 
just what Black needs to make use of the activity 
Dufresne created with 11...b5. White could have 
obtained a much more crushing position after 
either of the two prosaic moves. Firstly, 17.Ng3; 
for example, 17...Qh6 18.Bc1 (Kasparov’s choice; 
18.Rad1 and even 18.Nf5 Nxf5 19.Bxf5 are at least 
equally overwhelming, but chasing the queen is 
very natural) 18...Qe6 19.Bc4 Nd5 (19...Qg6 
20.Nh4 wins the queen, in view of 20...Qg4 
21.Bxf7+) 20.Ng5 Qg4 21.Re4 and again the 
queen perishes (Kasparov). 
Secondly, 17.Rad1 0-0 18.Ng3 Qh6 19.Bc1 Qe6 
20.Ng5 with catastrophic material loss for Black 
in a variety of ways, 1-0 (25) Dragon 3.1-Stockfish, 
Classics 2022. 
17...gxf6 18.exf6 Rg8! 
 
Dufresne finds the best move, setting up some 
counter-threats along the open g-file. Now we 
have reached the critical position, to which page 
after page of analysis has been devoted over the 
years. 
19.Rad1! 
Anderssen chooses the sacrificial move, setting 
up a beautiful trap, which duly succeeds and is 
the reason this game acquired its nickname and 
its anthological popularity. But objectively, the 
position is only equal. 
The alternative was 19.Be4, which was White’s 
best move objectively, still with a chance of a 
slight advantage in a crazy position. 19...Qh3 
20.g3 Rxg3+ 21.hxg3 Qxg3+ 22.Kh1 Bxf2 (if 
22...Qh3+?, 23.Nh2 wins) 
 
analysis diagram 
A) If 23.Re2??, 23...Nd4 wins; 
B) 23.Bd5 Bxe1 (23...Qh3+ 24.Nh2 Bxe1 25.Rxe1 
Ne5 26.Bxb7 Rxb7 27.Qa6 Rb6 28.Qxa7 d6 29.fxe7 
½-½ Dragon 3.2-Stockfish, Classics 2023) 24.Rxe1 
Ne5! 25.Bxb7 Rxb7 26.Qe4 Qxf3+ 27.Qxf3 Nxf3 
28.Rxe7+ Kd8 29.Rxf7 ½-½ Stockfish-Dragon 3.2, 
Classics 2023. The ending should be drawn, e.g. 
29...d6 30.Rxh7 Ng5 31.Rg7 Rb5 followed by ...Rf5; 
C) 23.Bxe7 Qh3+ 24.Nh2 Bxe1 25.Rxe1 

 
analysis diagram 
½-½ Stockfish-Dragon 3.1, Classics 2022. 
A simple draw for the engines... let’s carry on the 
game for a few more moves: 25...Qh4! (the only 
move: 25...Qxc3 26.Nf3 is winning for White) 
26.Qd1 (also the only move to hold the balance 
against the threat of ...Nxe7) 26...Nxe7 27.Bxb7 
Qxf6! 28.Bg2 Rb2 and Black has enough 
counterplay to hold the balance: 29.Qg4 Kd8 
30.Nf3 Qg6 31.Qh3 Rb1 32.Qh4 Rxe1+ and the 
engines again called it a day here! 
 
19...Qxf3? 
Grabbing material was almost seen as a moral 
duty in those days, but this allows Anderssen to 
show his genius idea. 
A) Decades of analysis have been devoted to 
19...Rg4 and it seems like a perfectly reasonable 
continuation for Black, though not in the 
engines’ top choices. Now: 
A1) 20.Re4 Rxe4 21.Qxe4 d6 22.Re1 Qg6 23.Qxe7+ 
Nxe7 24.Rxe7+ Kf8 25.Bxg6 hxg6 26.Bc1 Bd5 
27.h3 Bxa2 28.Re4 Kg8 29.Bh6 Bd5 30.Rh4 Bxf3 
31.gxf3 g5 (necessary to free the black king 
before Bg7 happens) 32.Bxg5 Bc5 33.Kg2 Rb2 
34.Rg4 ½-½ Dragon 3.2-Stockfish, Classics 2023. 
Equal for the engines, still a sharp, unbalanced 
endgame for humans; 
A2) 20.Bc4 was punted by Stockfish and leads to 
some crazy tactics: 20...Qf5 21.Rxd7 Kxd7 
(21...Qxd7 22.Rxe7+ Nxe7 23.Bxf7+ is the point: 
23...Kxf7 24.Ne5+ Kxf6 25.Nxd7+; 21...Rxg2+ 
22.Kxg2 Qg4+ 23.Kf1 Qh3+ 24.Ke2 Qxd7. 
(threatening ...Nd4+) 25.Qb5 Ng6 26.Qg5 and 
the attack continues) 22.Ne5+ Kc8 23.Nxg4 Nd5 
24.Re8+ Nd8 25.Be7 c6 26.Bxd8 Bxd8 27.Ne5 
Kc7 28.Qa5+ Nb6 29.Rf8 ½-½ Stockfish-Dragon 
3.2, Classics 2023. 29...Bxf6 30.Rxf7+ Kc8 and all 
three results are possible! White can take a draw 
by repetition with 31.Rf8+ to start with. 
B) Instead, the engine’s first choice is 19...Bd4!, 
a desperado sacrifice to block the d-file. After 
20.cxd4 (20.Bf1 Bxf6 eliminates the f6-pawn and 
leaves White only fighting to hold the balance; 
20.Bxe7 Rxg2+ 21.Kxg2 Ne5 is the amazing idea, 
finally revealing the genius behind 11...b5!) 
20...Qxf3 21.Be4 Rxg2+ 22.Kh1 Rxh2+ 23.Kxh2 
Qxf2+ 24.Kh1. 
 
analysis diagram 
Black can give perpetual check by 24...Qh4+ 
25.Kg2 with a draw by perpetual, ½-½ Stockfish-
Dragon 3.1, Classics 2022, and can even do so 
more 
spectacularly 
with 
24...Nf5 
25.Bg2+ 
(25.Bxf5+ Ne5+ 26.d5 Qxf5 is also only a draw) 
25...Ne3 26.Rxe3+ Qxe3 27.d5 Qh6+ 28.Kg1 Qe3+ 
etc.; 
C) 19...Qh3 is the engine’s second choice, and 
also leads to some sort of equality after 20.Bf1 
Qf5 and now – amazingly for such a sharp 
position – there seem to be multiple ways White 
can play that do not affect the balance of the 
position, among which 21.Bd3, 21.Kh1 and even 
21.h4 ! We’ll show you the most outrageous: 21.c4 
Ba8 22.Kh1 Qxf6 23.Bxe7 Nxe7 24.Rxd7 Kf8 
25.Rexe7 Qxf3 26.c5 Qxg2+ 27.Bxg2 ½-½ Dragon
