1... b5 $1 { Usually it is a bad idea to advance pawns in front of your king when you are being attacked, but here White’s a4-knight is unable to get in on the action. Instead in the game Black chose 22...Nf3+?, when 23 Kg2! b5 24 Qb4! would have been winning for White. } 2. Qb4 Qh4 $1 3. Bxd4 { Not: 24 Qa5? Rxe3! 25 Qxa6+ Kd8–+; 24 Rxd4? Rxe3! 25 fxe3 Qg3+ 26 Kf1 Qf3+ 27 Ke1 Qxe3+ 28 Kd1 Bxd4–+. } 3... Qxh3 $1 4. Bxg7 Re4 { Black can also play 25...Be4 26 Nxe4 Qxg4+ 27 Kh2 Qh4+ 28 Kg1 Qg4+ =, drawing thanks to the pin along White’s fourth rank. } 5. Nxe4 Qxg4+ { With a draw by repetition after either 27 Kh2 Qh3+ 28 Kg1 Qg4+ or 27 Kf1 Qxd1+ 28 Kg2 (28 Qe1?? Bh3+–+) 28...Qg4+ =. } *
