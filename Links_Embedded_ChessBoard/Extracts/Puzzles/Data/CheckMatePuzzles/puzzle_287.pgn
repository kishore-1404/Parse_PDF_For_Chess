1. Nf6 $1 { The combination works because of Black’s poorly placed rook on a6. We should note that deep computer analysis shows that 28 f6 and 28 g6 also give White a strong attack, but they are far more complex and certainly less good practical options. } 1... Rxe1+ { 28...Rd8 29 Nxh7 Rxd4 (29...Nxh7 30 g6+– leads to mate) 30 Qxd4 Qg3+ 31 Kf1 Kxh7 32 Qg4+–. } 2. Rxe1 Ra8 { 29...gxf6 30 Re8 Qd6 31 gxf6+–. } 3. Nxh7 $1 Kg8 { 30...Nxh7 31 g6+– leads to mate. } 4. Nxf8 Rxf8 5. g6 { Mate follows after 32...fxg6 33 fxg6. } 1-0
