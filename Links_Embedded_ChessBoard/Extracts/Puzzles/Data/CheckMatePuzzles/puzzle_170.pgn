1. Nxe6 $1 { 21 Rc3? was played in the game but after 21...Qe4 it turned out that White had no advantage: a) White chose 22 Rg3?, when 22...Kh8! would have left Black with a clear extra pawn. b) 22 Nxc6 Qxc6 (22...bxc6? 23 h3!) 23 Be2 Nc5! 24 Rxd8 Rxd8 25 Nxg7 Bxg7 26 Rg3 Kf8 and the game remains roughly equal. c) 22 Bd3 Ne5! 23 Nf6+ Kh8 also keeps the game sharp but ultimately equal. } 1... fxe6 2.
