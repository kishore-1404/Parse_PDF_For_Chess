1... Qe7 $1 { White has no reasonable defence to the threat of 40...Qxh4+ followed by mate. Other moves are much weaker; for example: a) After 39...Rxh4+? (as played in the game) White can maintain the balance: 40 Kg1 Qxe2 (Black actually chose 40...Rxg4+?! and ended up losing, as White need no longer take the draw) 41 Qd8+ Rg8 42 Qf6+ Rg7 43 Qf8+ Rg8 44 Qf6+ with a draw by repetition. b) 39...Qxe2? 40 Qd8+ Rg8 41 Qf6+ Rg7 42 Qf8+ Rg8 43 Qf6+ = with a draw by repetition. } *
