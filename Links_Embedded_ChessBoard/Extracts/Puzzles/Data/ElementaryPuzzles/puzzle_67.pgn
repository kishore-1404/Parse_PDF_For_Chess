1. Qg3 $1 { Black is OK if White captures the rook. For example: 12 Qxh8? Qxg5 13 Qxg8+ Ke7 14 Qxh7+ (14 Qxa8? Bxh1 favours Black) 14...Kd6 with roughly equal chances. } 1... Bxh1 { After 12...Nge7 White wins a piece for two pawns and retains a powerful pair of bishops. Following 13 Qxg2 0-0 (as played in the game), one good option is 14 h4+â€“. } 2. Bxd8 Nxd8 3. O-O-O Bb7 4. d5 { Sometimes the simplest moves (12 Qg3!) are the best moves. } *
