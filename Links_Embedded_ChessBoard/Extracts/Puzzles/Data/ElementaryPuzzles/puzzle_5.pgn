1. Qd8+ { White should force a repetition with: } 1... Ke6 2. Qd5+ Ke7 3. Qd8+ { The game ended with 40 g4?? Qg2+ 0-1 in view of 41 Kxg2 Ne3+ 42 Kf2 Nxd5 43 Rxd5 c2–+. White’s 40 g4?? was a misguided idea because in addition to the game continuation, 40...Kf8, 40...Nd4 and 40...Rc8 all win for Black. } *
