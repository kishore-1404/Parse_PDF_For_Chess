1... Qc2+ $1 { The only move to counter White’s kingside mating threats. } 2. Qxc2 Rxc2 3. Kxc2 Rxa2+ 4. Kb1 { 34 Kd3?? Bc5 (or 34...Bb6) leads to mate as White cannot defend against the dual threats of ...Ba6# and ...Ne5#. } 4... Ra1+ 5. Kc2 { Now Black’s safest option is 35...Ra2+ with a draw by repetition. Instead 35...Rxd1 (as played in the game) 36 Kxd1 may give White a slight edge thanks to his active rook. } *
