1. Nf6 $1 { Threatening Qe8+ followed by mate. } 1... Qa4 { The knight is immune from capture as 33...gxf6 34 Qxf6+ Kg8 35 Re7 leads to mate. Now (after 33...Qa4) White has a choice of winning ideas; the clearest is 34 Qf5 gxf6 35 Qxf6+ Kg8 36 Qg6+ Kf8 37 Qxh6+ Kg8 38 Qg6+ Kf8 39 Re6 as Black loses too much material. } *
