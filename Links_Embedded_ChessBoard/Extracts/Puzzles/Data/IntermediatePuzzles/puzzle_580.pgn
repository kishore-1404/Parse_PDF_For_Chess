1. Rxe4 $1 dxe4 2. Rd7 Qxa2 { 33...Qxf8 34 Rxb7+– is an easy win for White as the f5-pawn will drop off. Now (after 33...Qxa2), White’s eventual aim is still to take the f5- pawn, after which Black’s game will disintegrate. But not by 34 Nxf5? Rxf8 35 Rxb7 e3!? as in the game (objectively equal only if White plays accurately). Instead 34 Nhg6+ (34 Nfg6+ and 34 Nxh7 are strong too) 34...hxg6 35 Nxg6+ Kg8 36 Rxb7+– wins as f5 falls. } *
